## Launch phy with an eid and probe_name

To launch phy, first follow [these instructions](https://github.com//int-brain-lab/iblenv) for setting up a unified IBL conda environment.

Then in your terminal, make sure you are on the 'develop' branch of this repository, activate your unified conda environment, and run:

`python "<path/to/phy_launcher.py>" "<eid>" "<probe_name>"`

e.g. `python "~/int-brain-lab/iblapps/launch_phy/phy_launcher.py" "a3df91c8-52a6-4afa-957b-3479a7d0897c" "probe00"`
